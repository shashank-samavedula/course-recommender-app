The primary objective of this project is to enhance the learning journey for students by facilitating the discovery of new courses aligned with their interests, thereby optimizing their
learning paths.
Concurrently, by leveraging recommender systems to facilitate increased learner engagement with various courses, there's potential to boost the company's revenue.
Currently, the project is in the Proof of Concept (PoC) phase, prioritizing the exploration and comparison of different machine learningmodels to identify the one that exhibits optimal performance in offline evaluations.

This project is a part of the IBM Machine Learning Professional Certificate Capstone.
